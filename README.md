OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

 PROJECT: SIMPLE CALCULATOR![simple calculator output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/469c01a2-5c6a-4569-8396-224d8e6b74d4)


 **Objective**:
The Simple Calculator Program offers a user-friendly tool to perform basic arithmetic operations, serving as an educational example of Pythonâ€™s capabilities in handling basic computations and user interaction.

 **Key Activities**:
The program collects numerical inputs from the user, allows them to select an operation, performs the calculation, and displays the result. It includes basic error handling, such as checking for division by zero and managing invalid choices.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Python Programming Language**: Chosen for its readability and beginner-friendly syntax.
- **Standard Input/Output**: Utilizes `input()` for user data collection and `print()` for output display.
- **Conditional Statements and Functions**: `if-elif` statements and modular functions streamline the logic and improve code clarity.

**Key Insights**:
- **Modularity**: Breaking down each operation into functions makes the code reusable and enhances readability.
- **Error Handling**: The program demonstrates basic error handling techniques, such as checking for division by zero, which improves its robustness.
- **User-Centric Design**: Simple prompts and clear instructions make it accessible for beginners, demonstrating the importance of intuitive user interface design in programming.
